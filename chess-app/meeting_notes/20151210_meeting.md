##Visual look at the board and pieces.

##Click on a piece and then you are going to click on a destination
 - Selected two x,y coordinates (one of which has a piece on it, or else it throws an error)
 - Top left is 0,0
 - Bottom right is 7,7

   Example (1,2) -> (3,4)
   We need to answer some questions:
    - Is that move valid for the board
        (does the piece stay on the board)?
    - Is the move valid for the piece?
    - Do we collide with another piece?
      - if so what do we do?
      - is it our piece?
      - is it an opponent?

## Edge cases
 - Casteling (Rook and King)
 - En Passant (Pawn -> Queen)
