## December 14, 2015 Meeting Notes

Tickets:

- We need to persist (save) to position of the piece
  - Continue to work on move piece logic

- Start to build out valid_move?
  - Is the move on the board?
  - Is the move valid for the piece - Focus on positive moves
    - Pawn
    - King
    - Queen
    - Bishop
    - Knight
    - Rook
  - Is it the turn of the piece moving (Start with White)?

- Add the ability to play against another player
  - update create_game so that it takes the player value from the dropdown and uses it when creating the game

- Is obstructed? (check the list of possible moves)
    - Is something in the way?
    - Is the obstruction friend or foe?
    - Can the piece deal with obstructions? (Knight)

game.rb notes

  Update white_player and black_player associations.
    -Specify the class_name and foreign_key so that it works with the user model: `belongs_to :black_player, class_name: "User", foreign_key: "black_player_id"`

    # Is the move on the board?
    # Is the move valid for the piece type?
    # Is the move obstructed?
    # Is it my turn?
    # Is it castling?
    # Is it Em Passant?
    # Is it Promotion?

Example Model with the King

```
class King < Piece

  def valid_moves

    # Example
    # return [
    #   [2, 0],
    #   [2, 1],
    #   [3, 1],
    #   [4, 1],
    #   [4, 0]
    # ]
  end

  # King is [3,0]
  #   Possible Moves are:
  #     [2, 0]
  #     [2, 1]
  #     [3, 1]
  #     [4, 1]
  #     [4, 0]

  # Possible approaches
  #   - Brute Force - manually collect
  #   all of the Possible moves

  #   - Manhattan Distance - like Brute Force
  #   2D array

  #   - Vector/Distance - obtain the direction
  #   of the move and how far you're going

end
```
