Discus Castling

- How to coordinate moves between the King and the rook
  - initiated by moving the King two spaces toward one of the two rooks

1. Send a message back to the front-end to say that castling is happening

### Next Steps

1. Check/Checkmate - See below
  Check - Evaluate after each move
    - Is the opponent king in check?
    - Is the current mover's king in check?

2. Opponent UI Update
3. Forfeit
4. Stalemate

#### Check

After every move - Example: White Player's turn

1. For the mover's pieces
  - Check every mover's piece to determine if the opposing king's location is in their valid_moves array
    - if true
      - accept the move, notify the opponent that they are in check (notification logic yet to be built)
      - (Next Steps - this may be complex) analyze the opposing king to determine if they can make a move the does not result in check. If they cannot make a move that does not result in check, then they are in checkmate
2. For the opponent's pieces
  - Check every opponent's piece to determine if the mover's king's location is in their valid_moves array - This is an illegal move, you can't put your own king in check with your move.
    - if true - reject the move

- If the mover's king is in check, their next move has to result in the king not being in check (This is actually covered by the rule above where you cannot end a turn with your own in check).

#### Checkmate

- For Number 1 - the opposing king is in check is true - determine if the opposing king has a valid_move that does not have a destination that is in the valid_moves of the mover's pieces.
